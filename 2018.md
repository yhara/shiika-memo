### Lambda

Syntax

- `f = fn(x: Int){ x + 1 }`
- `f = fn{|x: Int| x + 1 }`
- `f = fn<T>(x: T){ x }`
- How to invoke it?
  - Like method call?
    - `f(1)`
    - `g = fn(){ foo }; g()`
    - Unlike method invocation, parentheses are mandatory
    - Otherwise (i.e. if `g` is an invocation) we cannot pass `g` as an argument
  - `g.call(1)`
  - `g.(1)`
  - `g[1]`

Types

- `f = fn(x: Int){ x + 1 } :: Func1[Int, Int]`

Passing to method call

```
def foo(x: Int, f: (y: Int) -> Int)
  f(x)
end

foo(123){|y| y+1}

f = fn(y: Int){ y+1 }
foo(123, f)
```

### vararg

```
        class A
          def self.first(*b: Array<Int>) -> Int
            b.first
          end
        end
        A.first(1,2,3)
```

What is needed to implement this?

## 2018/06/04

### Class method and typaram

```
         class A<T>
           def self.foo(x: T) -> Void
           end

           def self.bar(x: Int) -> Void
           end
         end
```

Idea

- `A<Int>.foo(1)` is ok
- `A.foo(1)` is ng (SkNoMethodError)
- `A.bar(1)` is ok
- `A<String>.bar(1)` is... ok? ng? whichever?

## 2018/06/02

### Variance

Even if you don't add variance annotation to your language, you may need to care
about variance in some places:

- Functions
- Built-in classes like Array[T]

Actually Swift's arrays are "magically" covariant, though it does not have variance
annotations for user-defined classes.

## 2018/06/01

### Symbol for generics (again)

```
class Something<T <: String>
  def 
end
```

This is terrible.

```
class Something[T <: String]
  def 
end
```

Now I'm thinking to use `[]` again, even if APIs like `Set[]` become impossible.


## 2018/05/31

### Where typaram occurs

```
         class A<T>
           def initialize(@a: T, x: T)
             # Type of @a should be TyParam[T]
             # Type of x should be TyParam[T]
           end

           def foo(x: T) -> T
             # Type of x should be TyParam[T]
           end
           # It is better if the signature of foo is (x: TyParam[T]) -> TyParam[T]
           # I guess it is (x: TyRaw[T]) -> TyRaw[T] now (unconfirmed)
         end
```

- Change them to `TyParam<T>` on:
  - a) Ast::DefMethod?
    - It does not know its context (i.e. the surrounding DefClass) now
  - b) Typing SkMethod
    - Looks fine!

### Ast::TypeParameter

```
                # This `T` is Ast::TypeParameter
         class A<T>
```

### Type of `x`

```
         class A<T>
           def foo(x: T) -> Int
             x.abs  #=> I need to know its lower bound here.
                    # So type of `x` should be `TyParam["T"]`
           end
         end
         A<Int>.new.foo(1)
```

- Currently it's `TyRaw[T]`
- parser.ry.erb generates this TyRaw
  - Because it does not know T is a typaram here

### Another bug

Noticed that this program is also results in an exception.

```
         class A<T>
           def foo(x: T) -> Int
             x.abs
           end
         end
         A<Int>.new.foo(1)

# expected Shiika::Program::SkTypeError, got #<KeyError: key not found: "T"> with backtrace:
#  ./lib/shiika/program/env.rb:88:in `fetch'
#  ./lib/shiika/program/env.rb:88:in `find_method'
```

The correct exception is an SkTypeError. (because x does not always have `.abs` method)

### Current status

- Type of `@a` is `TyRaw[T]`
- Should be `TyParam[T]` or something? :thinking_face:
- For method parameters, we inject type arguments "lazily"
  - @sk_methods of SkSpecializedClass is empty at first.
    Methods are created when they are called (i.e. its invocation is found during type checking)
- options:
  - a) Do it lazily for ivars too
  - b) Do it eagerly
- No, this question is wrong. We want to know the lower bound of `@a` while
  typing the SkGenericClass `A`.

### oh

This program should be invalid.

         class A<T>
           def initialize(@a: T)
             @a = 2
           end
         end
         A<Int>.new(1)

Because the lower bound of `T` is `Object` and is not compatible with `2`(`Int`).
(XXX: I'm not confident about the relation between lower bound and assignment)

### find_ivar

- Currently `Program::Env#find_ivar` lookups ivar from :sk_self
- It looks sk_self.sk_ivars

### ivars of generic class

```
class A<T>
  def initialize(@a: T)
  end
end
```

- `A` itself does not have ivars?
  - This seems to be a subtle problem because we can never touch them
  - But the SkGenericClass must have `@a` because it will be used when
    creating a SkSpecializedClass
- `A<Int>` has an ivar `@a` whose type is `Int`
  - When creating a SkSpecializedClass, its ivars must have appropreate type

### Concrete class, abstract class

- String is a concrete class
- Array is an abstract class
- `Array<Int>` is a concrete class

## 2018/05/05

### When to create SkSpecializedClass?

- Specialized class may appear in the program as:
  - part of an expression. eg: `Pair<Int, Int>.new`
  - type specification. eg: `def f(x: Pair<Int, Int>)`

## 2018/05/04

### Typecheck of generic methods

```rb
class A<T>
  def foo(x: T)
    x.abs
  end
end
A<Int>.new.foo(1)
```

- On typechecking the call of `foo`, we need to know that `T` is `Int`
- However, on typechecking the body of `foo`, we need to "forget" `T` is `Int` in this program
  - Because T could be another type in other part of the program

Therefore:

- The body of `foo` is typechecked only once
  - x is considered to be an instance of `Object` (the upper bound of T)
- On the other hand, different SkMethod will be created for each `A<??>`
  - eg. `A<Int>#foo(x: Int)`

## 2018/05/03

### .new of a specialized class

- SkGenericMetaClass never have `.new`
- However, SkSpecializedMetaClass should have a `.new`, magically
- Here we need a special rule
- Note that SkGenericClass may have `#initialize`

### Env#find_method

- When typechecking a call of a generic method, we need to create a specialized version of the SkMethod 
- Conceptually, each SkSpecialized(Meta)Class has all the method defined in SkGeneric(Meta)Class
- But I want to create them lazily
- Anyway, type arguments are needed to instantiate a generic method
  - SkSpecialized(Meta)Class knows the type args

### Infinite loop on #inspect

               <-  #sk_class
     SkClass              SkMetaClass
       #meta_class  ->

TODO: remove SkClass#meta_class (find from env instead)

### When to check type of specialized class?

- a) When it is first used
- b) On typecheck the ClassSpecialization

b.

### `Pair<Int,Int>.new`

1. Check type of the MethodCall (method_name: "new")
1. Find method "new" of SkSpeMeta `Pair<Int,Int>` 
1. But SkSpecializedMetaClass `Pair<Int,Int>` is not yet created here

## 2018/05/02

### SkMethod#sk_class ?

```
class A<X>
  def foo<Y>(x: X, y: Y)
  end
end
a = A<Int>.new
a.foo<Int>(1, 2)
```

- The signature of `A#foo` is `(x: X, y: Y) -> Void`
- To typecheck the call of `A#foo`, actual type of X and Y is needed
- How to get X ?
  - a) SkMethod has typarams == ['X', 'Y']
  - b) SkMethod has reference to SkClass

## 2018/04/16

### Oh

- If `Set[Int]` is `Set.[](Int)`, we could never write `Set[1,2,3]`!

## 2018/04/13

### Hmm

- SkMethod(...)
- SkGenericMethod(..., type_parameters)
- SkSpecializedMethod(..., type_parameters, type_arguments)

## 2018/04/11

### TODO

- Syntax of types is extended
  - `def foo(a: Int)`
  - `def foo(a: Pair[Int, Int])`
  - `def foo(a: Pair[Int, Pair[Int, Int]])`

## 2018/04/07

### `Pair.[]` should not be a method

Reason: 

- `a = Pair[Int, String].new(1, "foo")` is a valid code
- But it is nice if type parameters are automatically inferred:
  - `a = Pair.new(1, "foo")`
- It is very odd to say "Invocation of Pair.[] is ommited here"
- vs.
  - `a = Pair<Int, String>.new(1, "foo")` 
  - `a = Pair.new(1, "foo")` 
  - "<> is a notation for typarmas and sometimes you can omit it"

### Can we define `Pair.[]` ?

- `Pair.[]` takes two class objects and returns a class object
- i.e. `Pair[Int, String]` returns a class object `Pair[Int, String]`
- `Pair[1, 2]` is nonsense. i.e. the arguments must be classes
- So the signature should be `Pair[S, T] -> Pair[S, T], where S <: Meta:Object and T <: Meta:Object` ?

### Method that takes a class

- Given `def bar(x: Object)`
  - `bar(Object.new)` is ok
  - `bar(Int.new)` is ok because `Int <: Object`
- Given `def foo(x: Meta:Int)`
  - `foo(Int)` is the only way to call this method
  - How to allow `foo(Object)` ?
  - What object `Int.superclass` evaluates to?
    - `Object` seems natural
  - If `Meta:Int <: Meta:Object` ?

```
Int <: Object
Meta:Int <: Meta:Object <: Class
Pair <: GenericClass
Meta:Pair <: GenericClass
```

## 2018/04/06

### Remember the problem

Exception: 

> Shiika::Program::SkTypeError:
>   class `Meta:Pair' does not have a method `[]'

Shiika source:

      Pair[Int, Bool].new(1, true).fst

Problem:

- Can we define `Pair.[]` ?
  - What type will it have?
    - `Pair.[][S, T] :: (S, T) -> Pair[S, T]` ?
    - NO.
    - `Pair.[]` takes two classes, not usual objects
- Maybe `[]` should not be a method
  - In that case I would choose `Pair<S, T>` notation

### Singleton method and metaclass

- `1.class` returns a object `Int`
- I've learned that we need a type for that 
  - so it is not possible to introduce singleton methods "instead of" metaclasses.

## 2018/04/04

### Hmm

- Introducing 'singleton method' means that some objects has special methods
- To check 'what methods that object has', special type is needed
  - A type for a single object
- How should I call it?
  - `Meta:A`
    - `A : Meta:A` 
    - `a.class : Meta:A`
    - `A.class : Meta`
  - `Class:A`
    - `A : Class:A` 
    - `a.class : Class:A`
    - `A.class : Class`
- We need a type of a class
  - or a class of a class
  - which cannot be just a `Class` (because of singleton methods)
- I'm glad if all types are classes
  - so type of a class should be a class
  - and not just a `Class`
  - `Meta:A` should be a class (with special naming rule)

### self

```ruby
   # SkClass
      def calc_type!(env)
        @sk_ivars.each_value{|x| x.add_type!(env)}
        senv = env.merge(:sk_self, self)  #???
        @class_methods.each_value{|x| x.add_type!(senv)}
        menv = env.merge(:sk_self, self)
        @sk_methods.each_value{|x| x.add_type!(menv)}
        return env, TyRaw[name]
      end
```

- We need to know what method can be called on `self`
- `menv = env.merge(:sk_self, self)`
  - On type checking in an instance method, `:sk_self` is a `SkClass`
- How about in a class method?
  - `self` is an instance of `Class`, but has singleton methods
- Maybe we need to introduce something like `Class:A`?
  - `A.type` in Scala?
  - https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/03-types.html#singleton-types
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33052086/what-is-a-singleton-type-exactly

## 2018/04/03

### Next task

- Remove metaclass and introduce singleton method
- Only Classes/Modules can have singleton methods
- On method invoation, if the receiver is a Class/Module, singleton methods should be searched

### I'm back

Mostly forgot what to do next.

## 2018/03/11

### Singleton class in Ruby

- Each ruby object has its singleton classes
  - Which holds its singleton methods
- In this way, method lookup could be implemented straight-forward

## 2018/03/09

### Superclass

- String is an instance of Class
- String's superclass is Object
- Array is an intance of Class
- Array's superclass template is `Object`
- Array[Int] is an instance of Class
- Array[Int]'s superclass is Object
- If one defined SortedArray[T] < Array[T]:
  - SortedArray is an intance of Class
  - SortedArray[T]'s superclass template is `Array[T]`
  - SortedArray[Int] is an instance of Class
  - SortedArray[Int]'s superclass is Array[Int]
- Class is an instance of Class
- Class's superclass is Module
- Module is an instance of Class
- Module's superclass is Object
- Object is an instance of Class
- Object's superclass is nil

### Metaclass vs. singleton methods

Maybe Metaclass model is too complex... :thinking:
How about singleton methods?

- Allow classes to have singleton methods
  - (Unlike Ruby, singleton methods are allowed only to Classes and Modules)
- `String.new() -> String` is a singleton method of `String`
- `String` itself is an instance of `Class` class
  - There are many instances of `Class` class but their `.new` method
    have all different signature
  - This is legal because they are singleton method

So next question is how to mix this with generics.

- `Array.new` is not allowed
- `Array[Int].new(100)` should be legal
  - So specialized class `Array[Int]` has a singleton method `new(Int) -> Array[Int]`
- `Array` does not have `.new` but has some other methods
  - Like `Array.constants`?
  - This method is defined in `Class` (or inherited from the superclass `Module`)
    - Remember `Array` is an instance of `Class`
    - (Memo: `Class` is also an instance of `Class`)

### Metaclass

- `"foo".reverse`
  - String#reverse() -> String
- `"foo".object_id`
  - Object#object_id() -> Int
- `String.new`
  - Meta:String#new() -> String

- `[1,2,3].reverse`
  - Array[Int]#reverse() -> Array[Int]
- `Array[Int].new(1,2,3)`
  - Meta:Array[Int]#new(*items) -> Array[Int]

### Metaclasses in Smalltalk

(I'm not sure this is correct)

- Everything is object
- So class itself is an object
- For each class `X`, there is a metaclass `X class`
  - Metaclass is also an object (instance of `Metaclass`)
    - `Metaclass` is also an object (instance of `Metaclass` itself, so there is no things like meta-meta-class)

## 2018/03/08

### Meta:Pair

:thinking:

```
 Object     Meta:Object  "Object"      Object    GenericClass   Meta:Object
 .object_id  .new                                    .[]
   v           v            v             v           v             v
  Int        Meta:Int   Pair[S,T]   Pair[Int,Int] Meta:Pair  Meta:Pair[Int,Int]
```

### Current status

Exception: 

> Shiika::Program::SkTypeError:
>   class `Meta:Pair' does not have a method `[]'

Shiika source:

      Pair[Int, Bool].new(1, true).fst

`Pair[Int, Bool]` is parsed as `Pair.[](Int, Bool)` here.
So generic class `Pair` should have a class method `[]`.

## 2018/03/04

### Container classes in Ruby

- Array[T]
- Hash[K, V]
- Set[T]  (stdlib)

and Enumerable?

## 2018/03/02

### What to do next

      class Pair[S, T]
        # Here we refer to `S`, but env.find_type raises "unknown type: S"
        def initialize(@a: S, @b: T)
        end

        def fst -> S; @a; end
        def snd -> T; @b; end
      end
      Pair[Int, Bool].new(1, true).fst

- `env.find_type('S')` should return something
  - Like `Type::Typaram`?
    - Currently it is almost the same as `Object`
    - This object will have the information about upper/lower bound, if introduced
      - to tell if a class confirms to the type

## 2018/03/01

### Keyword argument

(Current idea) All methods can be invoked with keyword arguments.

```
def foo(a: Int = 1, b: Int = 2); end

foo(3, 4)
foo(3, b: 4)     # Allow this?
foo(b: 4, a: 3)
```

## 2018/02/28

### Types in Shiika

:thinking:

- Value types
  - Concrete value types
    - Class type
  - Abstract value types
    - Type parameter
- Non-value types
  - Generic class
  - Method signature
  - Function signature?

## 2018/02/27

### Types in Scala

https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/03-types.html#paths

- Value types
  - Concrete value types
    - Class type
    - Compound type
  - Abstract value types
    - Type parameter
    - Abstract type binding
- Non-value types
  - Type constructor
  - Method type

## 2018/02/25

### Scala functions

- `Int => Int` is just a [shorthand](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/03-types.html#function-types) of `Function1[Int, Int]`
- This type does not include all information about the function (eg. default value for a parameter)
- IOW this type includes all the information for type checking
  - Arity
  - Types of each paraemter
  - Type of the return value

## 2018/02/24

### Signature of closures?

```
f = fn(x){ x + 1 }
```

What is "type" and/or "signature" of f?

## 2018/02/23

### Type vs. Signature

- What is "signature"?
  - Is it a type or not?
- eg. In Haskell:
  - Every value belongs to a type
  - Functions are values
  - So each function belongs to a type such as `f :: Int -> Int`
  - Application `f "foo"` is a type error
- In Shiika, methods are not first-class value
  - But off course, we want to check type errors for method calls
  - There should be information of what a method takes and returns (= Signature)

## 2018/02/20

### Funcion call or variable reference

```rb
  def do_task(after: () -> Void)
    # do something

    # This may look like a function call, but...
    after

    # There's a case that passing `after` to another function,
    # so `after` should be a variable reference.
    do_task_2(after)

    # Allow this?
    after()

    # How about these?
    another()  # Call of another method
    another    # Allow this or prohibit this?
  end

  def another
  end
```

## 2018/02/19

### Nullary-function problem

- Ruby's `Proc` is like function but has different syntax to invoke

```rb
def foo(*args); end
bar = Proc.new

foo  # Method call
bar  # Variable reference
foo(1)  # Method call
bar(1)  # *Error*
bar.call(1)  # OK

bar[1]       # Alternative syntax of call (`#[]` is an alias of `#call`)
bar.(1)      # Alternative syntax of call (rarely used, though)
```

Note that you need to write `bar.call` to invoke the function with 0 arguments.

## 2018/02/18

### Function type?

- Swift has function as first-class value
  - But there is no class for function?
  - https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Types.html#//apple_ref/swift/grammar/function-type
  - Functions and tuples look like special in Swift
- Scala has function as first-class value
  - They are instances of `Function0` 〜 `Function22`
  - With syntax sugar `f(x)` = `f.apply(x)`
  - Method, on the other hand, is not a first-class value
- Ruby has no "function"
  - But has `Proc` class instead
  - Ruby also has `Method` class (not so popular as `Proc`)

## 2018/02/17

### Data structure for types

- What object should `env.find_type` return?
  - It should be able to tell an object conforms (= its class conforms) to the type

### Type syntax

- Types can be appeared in some place of a program
  - Function signature (params, return value)
  - Instance variable type
  - Cast
- Type syntax
  - Class name (non-generic)
    - => An instance of the class or its subclasses
  - Class name (generic)
    - => Illegal (type argument required)
  - Generic class name + type arguments
    - eg. `Stack[Int]`
    - => Instance of the class
    - (This will change once covariance/contravariance are introduced)
  - Type parameter name
    - => An instance of the class Object or its subclasses
    - (Once upper/lower bounds are introduced, instance of a class between the bound)

## 2018/02/16

### What is type

- Given `x: Foo`, x is an instance of Foo or its subclasses
  - Type = set of classes
- `x: Array` is not allowed (missing type argument)
  - Shiika needs a definition of type syntax

### Is `Stack[Int]` a class?

No?

### Generics

Thinking about generics since the new year. Shiika won't have even the class Array without it.

Notes:

- Use `[]` for generics syntax
- Reason1: `<>` is not suitable when `<:` and `>:` are introduced to denote upper/lower bound
  - Swift uses `:` to denote upper bound (No syntax for lower bound)
- Reason2: `Stack[T]` looks like a method call :-)
  - Can we define this as method call?
  - `Stack#[]` to return specialized class

## 2018/02/15

### MetaClass

- In Ruby, `Array` evaluates to an object (an instance of the `Class` class)
- In Shiika too?
- But `Array.new` and `String.new` have different signature
  - In Ruby, `new` is their "singleton method" so they can behave
    differently even the name is the same
- No plan to introduce "singleton method" to Shiika
- MetaClass
  - `Array` evaluates to an object
  - Its class is `Meta:Array` (metaclass of Array)
  - `new` is defined on `Meta:Array`

### Shiika

- Static typing
- Ruby-like syntax
  - But not 100% compatible
- Interpreter is written in Ruby (for now)
  - Future plan: compile to LLVM IR (using Go or something?)
- Challenge
  - Rubyish + Static type system

### Enum and number

```
enum Status
  # Pattern 1
  case Initialized do
    def to_i; 1; end
  end
  case Processing(progress: Float) do
    def to_i; 2; end
  end
  case Done(result: Int)
  case Error(msg: String)

  # Pattern 2
  case class Initialized
    def to_i; 1; end
  end
  case class Processing(progress: Float)
    def to_i; 2; end
  end
  case Done(result: Int)
  case Error(msg: String)

  # Pattern 3 (swift style)
  def to_i
    case self
    when Initialized then 1
    when Processing then 2
    when Done then 3
    when Error then 4
    end
  end
end
```

Scala: https://dev.classmethod.jp/server-side/scala-algebra-data-type/

```
sealed abstract class IndexedEnum(val index: Int)
 
case object IA extends IndexedEnum(1)   // You can specify the arguments for the superclass initializer
case object IB extends IndexedEnum(2)
case object IC extends IndexedEnum(3)
case object ID extends IndexedEnum(4)
```

### Enum and `def`

```
enum Status
  def foo
  end

  case class Initialized
    def foo
    end
  end
  case class Processing(progress: Float); end
  case class Done(result: Int); end
  case class Error(msg: String); end
end
```

:thinking_face:

### Enum

```
enum Status
  case Initialized
  case Processing(progress: Float)
  case Done(result: Int)
  case Error(msg: String)
end

status = Status::Initialized  # ???
status = Status::Processing.new(0.1)
status = Status::Done.new(result)
status = Status::Error.new("failed")
```

### Maybe

```
enum Maybe<T>
  case Some(value: T)
  case None
end
```

We need special care to

- write None as `nil`
- `T` is transparently compatible to `Maybe<T>` (like Swift, Crystal)

## 2018/09/11

### nitches

```
enum A
  case B(x: Int, y: Int)
end
case foo
when B(x, y)
when B(x)
when B(y)    # ??
when B(y, x) # ??
end
```

### Enum (tagged union)

```
class Result<T, E>
  class Ok<T> < Result<T, E>
    def initialize(@value: T); end
  end
  class Err<T> < Result<T, E>
    def initialize(@value: T); end
  end
end

def foo -> Result<Int, String>
  if bar
    Ok.new(1)
  else
    Err.new('failed')
  end
end

case foo
when Ok(value)
  p value
when Err(msg)
  p msg
else
  # How to make sure never reach here? 
end
```

```
enum Result<T, E>
  case Ok(value: T)
  case Err(value: E)
end

def foo -> Result<Int, String>
  if bar
    Result::Ok.new(1)
  else
    Result::Err.new('failed')
  end
end

case foo
when Ok(value)
  ...
when Error(msg)
  ...
else
  # Never reaches here (we cannot add new case to an enum)
end
```

### Maybe

https://qiita.com/koher/items/e4835bd429b88809ab33#comment-bca0e884f74ca1acdd9a

```
class Maybe<T>
  class Some<T> extends Maybe<T>
    def initialize(@value: T); end
  end
  class None extends Maybe<Nothing>  # Nothing: the bottom type
  end
end
nil = Maybe::None.new(??)

var a : Maybe<Int> = Some.new(1)
var a : Maybe<Int> = nil
```

### Changing signature on override

I found this is not an error in Scala because it has method overloads :thinking_face:

```scala
class A(id: String) {
  def foo(x: Int): Int = {
    x
  }
}
class B(id: String) extends A(id) {
  def foo(x: String): Int = {
    x.length() + 99
  }
}
class C(id: String) extends A(id) {
}

Array(new B("hi"), new C("c")).foreach(item => println(item.foo(1)))
```

- Method with the same name and different parameter types are considered different
- It is not allowed to define method with the same name, parameter types and different return type

## 2018/09/08

### `KeyError: key not found: "B<Int>"`

        class A; end
        class B<T> extends A; end
        var x = A.new
        x = B<Int>.new

1. `B<Int>` is instantiated while evaluating the rhs of `=`
2. It should be added to the env to type check `=`

## 2018/09/07

### Type and SkClass

Maybe we need only one of these?

## 2018/09/06

### Superclass and metaclass

```
- Array<T> < Object
- Meta:Array<T> < Meta:Object 

- B<T> < A<T>
- Meta:B<T> < Meta:A<T>
```

### Make sure every ivars are initialized on instance creation

- Rule 1(Parent class): `initialize` should initialize every ivar
- Rule 2(Child class): When overriding `initialize`, it should call `super` on all paths

```
class A
  def initialize(@a: Int)
    @b = 2
    var @c = 3
  end
end

class B extends A
  # NG
  def initialize
  end

  # OK 1
  def initialize(@a: Int)
  end

  # OK 2
  def initialize
    super(99)
  end
end
```

### Inheritance and initialize

```
class A
  def initialize(@a: Int)
  end
end

class B extends A
#  def initialize  # This is wrong because `b = B.new` does not initialize @a
#  end

  def initialize(@a: Int)
  end

  def initialize
    super(1)
  end
end
```

Java: Members are initialized by null

```java
class A<T> {
  public String id;
}
class B<T> extends A<T> {}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println(new B().id);  //=> null
  }
}
```

Scala: Pass arguments on extend

```scala
class A[T](id: String) {
}
// class B[T] extends A[T] {  // error: not enough arguments for constructor A: (id: String)this.A[T].
// }
class B[T](id: String) extends A[T](id) {
}
println(new B("hi"))
```

Swift: Memvers should have an initial value or initialized by `init` (or decalred as optional)

```swift
class A<T> {
    public let id: Int;
    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id;
    }
}
class B<T>: A<T> {}
print(B<Int>())  // error: missing argument for parameter 'id' in call
```

Swift: When overriding `init`, `super.init` must be called in every path

```swift
class A<T> {
    public let id: Int;
    public let foo: Int;
    init(id: Int) {
        self.id = id;
        self.foo = id;
    }
}
class B<T>: A<T> {
    override init(id: Int) {
        super.init(id: id)
        // Without this:
        // error: super.init isn't called on all paths before returning from initializer
    }
}
print(B<Int>(id: 1))
```

Crystal: like Swift

```crystal
class A
    def initialize(a : String)
        @a = a
    end
end
class B < A
    def initialize
        #return    # This causes Invalid memory acceess (^_^;
        super(1)
        # Without this:
        # Error in a.cr:7: this 'initialize' doesn't initialize instance variable '@a' of A, with B < A, rendering it nilable
    end
end

p B.new()
```

### Subtyping

- `class B<S, T> extends A<S, T, S, S>`
  - The direct superclass of `B<Int, Bool>` is
    `A<Int, Bool, Int, Int>`
- `class C<S, T> extends A<S, A<T, S>>`
  - The direct superclass of `C<Int, Bool>` is
    `A<Int, A<Bool, Int>>`
  - That is, `c = C<Int, Bool>.new` conforms to `A<Int, A<Bool, Int>>`

## 2018/07/07

### Type conformation

Sometimes we want to know a type conforms to another type.

```
class A<T> < B
  def foo(x: Array<T>)
    bar(x)
  end

  def bar(y: Foo<T>)
  end
end
```

- Method call `bar(x)` is legal when `Array<T>` conforms to `Foo<T>`.
  - For example, when Foo is defined as `class Foo<T> : Array<T>`

### Type and class

```
class A<T> < B
  def foo(x: Array<T>)
  end
end
```

`Array<T>` here is obviously "a type", but not "a class". A type may represent more than one classes.

### Subtyping

- `class A < B; end`
  - `A < B` (A is a subclass of B)
  - `A <: B` (A is a proper subclass of B, because A != B)
  - `A <1 B` (A is a direct subclass of B)
- `class C[T] < B`; end`
  - `C[T] < B`
  - `C[Int] < B`
- `class D[T] < C[T]`; end`
  - `D[Int] < C[Int]`
  - `class E[S]; def f(x: D[S])`

### Module

```
module M
  def foo
  end
end

class A
  include M
  #=> A.new.foo
  # A --> M --> Object
end

class B
  extend M
  #=> B.foo
  #=> Meta:B --> M --> Meta:Object
end
```

## 2018/06/27

### Lambda

Syntax

- `f = fn(x: Int){ x + 1 }`
- `f = fn{|x: Int| x + 1 }`
- `f = fn<T>(x: T){ x }`
- How to invoke it?
  - Like method call?
    - `f(1)`
    - `g = fn(){ foo }; g()`
    - Unlike method invocation, parentheses are mandatory
    - Otherwise (i.e. if `g` is an invocation) we cannot pass `g` as an argument
  - `g.call(1)`
  - `g.(1)`
  - `g[1]`

Types

- `f = fn(x: Int){ x + 1 } :: Func1[Int, Int]`

Passing to method call

```
def foo(x: Int, f: (y: Int) -> Int)
  f(x)
end

foo(123){|y| y+1}

f = fn(y: Int){ y+1 }
foo(123, f)
```

## 2018/06/08

### vararg

```
        class A
          def self.first(*b: Array<Int>) -> Int
            b.first
          end
        end
        A.first(1,2,3)
```

What is needed to implement this?

## 2018/06/04

### Class method and typaram

```
         class A<T>
           def self.foo(x: T) -> Void
           end

           def self.bar(x: Int) -> Void
           end
         end
```

Idea

- `A<Int>.foo(1)` is ok
- `A.foo(1)` is ng (SkNoMethodError)
- `A.bar(1)` is ok
- `A<String>.bar(1)` is... ok? ng? whichever?

## 2018/06/02

### Variance

Even if you don't add variance annotation to your language, you may need to care
about variance in some places:

- Functions
- Built-in classes like Array[T]

Actually Swift's arrays are "magically" covariant, though it does not have variance
annotations for user-defined classes.

## 2018/06/01

### Symbol for generics (again)

```
class Something<T <: String>
  def 
end
```

This is terrible.

```
class Something[T <: String]
  def 
end
```

Now I'm thinking to use `[]` again, even if APIs like `Set[]` become impossible.


## 2018/05/31

### Where typaram occurs

```
         class A<T>
           def initialize(@a: T, x: T)
             # Type of @a should be TyParam[T]
             # Type of x should be TyParam[T]
           end

           def foo(x: T) -> T
             # Type of x should be TyParam[T]
           end
           # It is better if the signature of foo is (x: TyParam[T]) -> TyParam[T]
           # I guess it is (x: TyRaw[T]) -> TyRaw[T] now (unconfirmed)
         end
```

- Change them to `TyParam<T>` on:
  - a) Ast::DefMethod?
    - It does not know its context (i.e. the surrounding DefClass) now
  - b) Typing SkMethod
    - Looks fine!

### Ast::TypeParameter

```
                # This `T` is Ast::TypeParameter
         class A<T>
```

### Type of `x`

```
         class A<T>
           def foo(x: T) -> Int
             x.abs  #=> I need to know its lower bound here.
                    # So type of `x` should be `TyParam["T"]`
           end
         end
         A<Int>.new.foo(1)
```

- Currently it's `TyRaw[T]`
- parser.ry.erb generates this TyRaw
  - Because it does not know T is a typaram here

### Another bug

Noticed that this program is also results in an exception.

```
         class A<T>
           def foo(x: T) -> Int
             x.abs
           end
         end
         A<Int>.new.foo(1)

# expected Shiika::Program::SkTypeError, got #<KeyError: key not found: "T"> with backtrace:
#  ./lib/shiika/program/env.rb:88:in `fetch'
#  ./lib/shiika/program/env.rb:88:in `find_method'
```

The correct exception is an SkTypeError. (because x does not always have `.abs` method)

### Current status

- Type of `@a` is `TyRaw[T]`
- Should be `TyParam[T]` or something? :thinking_face:
- For method parameters, we inject type arguments "lazily"
  - @sk_methods of SkSpecializedClass is empty at first.
    Methods are created when they are called (i.e. its invocation is found during type checking)
- options:
  - a) Do it lazily for ivars too
  - b) Do it eagerly
- No, this question is wrong. We want to know the lower bound of `@a` while
  typing the SkGenericClass `A`.

### oh

This program should be invalid.

         class A<T>
           def initialize(@a: T)
             @a = 2
           end
         end
         A<Int>.new(1)

Because the lower bound of `T` is `Object` and is not compatible with `2`(`Int`).
(XXX: I'm not confident about the relation between lower bound and assignment)

### find_ivar

- Currently `Program::Env#find_ivar` lookups ivar from :sk_self
- It looks sk_self.sk_ivars

### ivars of generic class

```
class A<T>
  def initialize(@a: T)
  end
end
```

- `A` itself does not have ivars?
  - This seems to be a subtle problem because we can never touch them
  - But the SkGenericClass must have `@a` because it will be used when
    creating a SkSpecializedClass
- `A<Int>` has an ivar `@a` whose type is `Int`
  - When creating a SkSpecializedClass, its ivars must have appropreate type

### Concrete class, abstract class

- String is a concrete class
- Array is an abstract class
- `Array<Int>` is a concrete class

## 2018/05/05

### When to create SkSpecializedClass?

- Specialized class may appear in the program as:
  - part of an expression. eg: `Pair<Int, Int>.new`
  - type specification. eg: `def f(x: Pair<Int, Int>)`

## 2018/05/04

### Typecheck of generic methods

```rb
class A<T>
  def foo(x: T)
    x.abs
  end
end
A<Int>.new.foo(1)
```

- On typechecking the call of `foo`, we need to know that `T` is `Int`
- However, on typechecking the body of `foo`, we need to "forget" `T` is `Int` in this program
  - Because T could be another type in other part of the program

Therefore:

- The body of `foo` is typechecked only once
  - x is considered to be an instance of `Object` (the upper bound of T)
- On the other hand, different SkMethod will be created for each `A<??>`
  - eg. `A<Int>#foo(x: Int)`

## 2018/05/03

### .new of a specialized class

- SkGenericMetaClass never have `.new`
- However, SkSpecializedMetaClass should have a `.new`, magically
- Here we need a special rule
- Note that SkGenericClass may have `#initialize`

### Env#find_method

- When typechecking a call of a generic method, we need to create a specialized version of the SkMethod 
- Conceptually, each SkSpecialized(Meta)Class has all the method defined in SkGeneric(Meta)Class
- But I want to create them lazily
- Anyway, type arguments are needed to instantiate a generic method
  - SkSpecialized(Meta)Class knows the type args

### Infinite loop on #inspect

               <-  #sk_class
     SkClass              SkMetaClass
       #meta_class  ->

TODO: remove SkClass#meta_class (find from env instead)

### When to check type of specialized class?

- a) When it is first used
- b) On typecheck the ClassSpecialization

b.

### `Pair<Int,Int>.new`

1. Check type of the MethodCall (method_name: "new")
1. Find method "new" of SkSpeMeta `Pair<Int,Int>` 
1. But SkSpecializedMetaClass `Pair<Int,Int>` is not yet created here

## 2018/05/02

### SkMethod#sk_class ?

```
class A<X>
  def foo<Y>(x: X, y: Y)
  end
end
a = A<Int>.new
a.foo<Int>(1, 2)
```

- The signature of `A#foo` is `(x: X, y: Y) -> Void`
- To typecheck the call of `A#foo`, actual type of X and Y is needed
- How to get X ?
  - a) SkMethod has typarams == ['X', 'Y']
  - b) SkMethod has reference to SkClass

## 2018/04/16

### Oh

- If `Set[Int]` is `Set.[](Int)`, we could never write `Set[1,2,3]`!

## 2018/04/13

### Hmm

- SkMethod(...)
- SkGenericMethod(..., type_parameters)
- SkSpecializedMethod(..., type_parameters, type_arguments)

## 2018/04/11

### TODO

- Syntax of types is extended
  - `def foo(a: Int)`
  - `def foo(a: Pair[Int, Int])`
  - `def foo(a: Pair[Int, Pair[Int, Int]])`

## 2018/04/07

### `Pair.[]` should not be a method

Reason: 

- `a = Pair[Int, String].new(1, "foo")` is a valid code
- But it is nice if type parameters are automatically inferred:
  - `a = Pair.new(1, "foo")`
- It is very odd to say "Invocation of Pair.[] is ommited here"
- vs.
  - `a = Pair<Int, String>.new(1, "foo")` 
  - `a = Pair.new(1, "foo")` 
  - "<> is a notation for typarmas and sometimes you can omit it"

### Can we define `Pair.[]` ?

- `Pair.[]` takes two class objects and returns a class object
- i.e. `Pair[Int, String]` returns a class object `Pair[Int, String]`
- `Pair[1, 2]` is nonsense. i.e. the arguments must be classes
- So the signature should be `Pair[S, T] -> Pair[S, T], where S <: Meta:Object and T <: Meta:Object` ?

### Method that takes a class

- Given `def bar(x: Object)`
  - `bar(Object.new)` is ok
  - `bar(Int.new)` is ok because `Int <: Object`
- Given `def foo(x: Meta:Int)`
  - `foo(Int)` is the only way to call this method
  - How to allow `foo(Object)` ?
  - What object `Int.superclass` evaluates to?
    - `Object` seems natural
  - If `Meta:Int <: Meta:Object` ?

```
Int <: Object
Meta:Int <: Meta:Object <: Class
Pair <: GenericClass
Meta:Pair <: GenericClass
```

## 2018/04/06

### Remember the problem

Exception: 

> Shiika::Program::SkTypeError:
>   class `Meta:Pair' does not have a method `[]'

Shiika source:

      Pair[Int, Bool].new(1, true).fst

Problem:

- Can we define `Pair.[]` ?
  - What type will it have?
    - `Pair.[][S, T] :: (S, T) -> Pair[S, T]` ?
    - NO.
    - `Pair.[]` takes two classes, not usual objects
- Maybe `[]` should not be a method
  - In that case I would choose `Pair<S, T>` notation

### Singleton method and metaclass

- `1.class` returns a object `Int`
- I've learned that we need a type for that 
  - so it is not possible to introduce singleton methods "instead of" metaclasses.

## 2018/04/04

### Hmm

- Introducing 'singleton method' means that some objects has special methods
- To check 'what methods that object has', special type is needed
  - A type for a single object
- How should I call it?
  - `Meta:A`
    - `A : Meta:A` 
    - `a.class : Meta:A`
    - `A.class : Meta`
  - `Class:A`
    - `A : Class:A` 
    - `a.class : Class:A`
    - `A.class : Class`
- We need a type of a class
  - or a class of a class
  - which cannot be just a `Class` (because of singleton methods)
- I'm glad if all types are classes
  - so type of a class should be a class
  - and not just a `Class`
  - `Meta:A` should be a class (with special naming rule)

### self

```ruby
   # SkClass
      def calc_type!(env)
        @sk_ivars.each_value{|x| x.add_type!(env)}
        senv = env.merge(:sk_self, self)  #???
        @class_methods.each_value{|x| x.add_type!(senv)}
        menv = env.merge(:sk_self, self)
        @sk_methods.each_value{|x| x.add_type!(menv)}
        return env, TyRaw[name]
      end
```

- We need to know what method can be called on `self`
- `menv = env.merge(:sk_self, self)`
  - On type checking in an instance method, `:sk_self` is a `SkClass`
- How about in a class method?
  - `self` is an instance of `Class`, but has singleton methods
- Maybe we need to introduce something like `Class:A`?
  - `A.type` in Scala?
  - https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/03-types.html#singleton-types
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33052086/what-is-a-singleton-type-exactly

## 2018/04/03

### Next task

- Remove metaclass and introduce singleton method
- Only Classes/Modules can have singleton methods
- On method invoation, if the receiver is a Class/Module, singleton methods should be searched

### I'm back

Mostly forgot what to do next.

## 2018/03/11

### Singleton class in Ruby

- Each ruby object has its singleton classes
  - Which holds its singleton methods
- In this way, method lookup could be implemented straight-forward

## 2018/03/09

### Superclass

- String is an instance of Class
- String's superclass is Object
- Array is an intance of Class
- Array's superclass template is `Object`
- Array[Int] is an instance of Class
- Array[Int]'s superclass is Object
- If one defined SortedArray[T] < Array[T]:
  - SortedArray is an intance of Class
  - SortedArray[T]'s superclass template is `Array[T]`
  - SortedArray[Int] is an instance of Class
  - SortedArray[Int]'s superclass is Array[Int]
- Class is an instance of Class
- Class's superclass is Module
- Module is an instance of Class
- Module's superclass is Object
- Object is an instance of Class
- Object's superclass is nil

### Metaclass vs. singleton methods

Maybe Metaclass model is too complex... :thinking:
How about singleton methods?

- Allow classes to have singleton methods
  - (Unlike Ruby, singleton methods are allowed only to Classes and Modules)
- `String.new() -> String` is a singleton method of `String`
- `String` itself is an instance of `Class` class
  - There are many instances of `Class` class but their `.new` method
    have all different signature
  - This is legal because they are singleton method

So next question is how to mix this with generics.

- `Array.new` is not allowed
- `Array[Int].new(100)` should be legal
  - So specialized class `Array[Int]` has a singleton method `new(Int) -> Array[Int]`
- `Array` does not have `.new` but has some other methods
  - Like `Array.constants`?
  - This method is defined in `Class` (or inherited from the superclass `Module`)
    - Remember `Array` is an instance of `Class`
    - (Memo: `Class` is also an instance of `Class`)

### Metaclass

- `"foo".reverse`
  - String#reverse() -> String
- `"foo".object_id`
  - Object#object_id() -> Int
- `String.new`
  - Meta:String#new() -> String

- `[1,2,3].reverse`
  - Array[Int]#reverse() -> Array[Int]
- `Array[Int].new(1,2,3)`
  - Meta:Array[Int]#new(*items) -> Array[Int]

### Metaclasses in Smalltalk

(I'm not sure this is correct)

- Everything is object
- So class itself is an object
- For each class `X`, there is a metaclass `X class`
  - Metaclass is also an object (instance of `Metaclass`)
    - `Metaclass` is also an object (instance of `Metaclass` itself, so there is no things like meta-meta-class)

### Meta:Pair

:thinking:

```
 Object     Meta:Object  "Object"      Object    GenericClass   Meta:Object
 .object_id  .new                                    .[]
   v           v            v             v           v             v
  Int        Meta:Int   Pair[S,T]   Pair[Int,Int] Meta:Pair  Meta:Pair[Int,Int]
```

### Current status

Exception: 

> Shiika::Program::SkTypeError:
>   class `Meta:Pair' does not have a method `[]'

Shiika source:

      Pair[Int, Bool].new(1, true).fst

`Pair[Int, Bool]` is parsed as `Pair.[](Int, Bool)` here.
So generic class `Pair` should have a class method `[]`.

### Container classes in Ruby

- Array[T]
- Hash[K, V]
- Set[T]  (stdlib)

and Enumerable?

## 2018/03/02

### What to do next

      class Pair[S, T]
        # Here we refer to `S`, but env.find_type raises "unknown type: S"
        def initialize(@a: S, @b: T)
        end

        def fst -> S; @a; end
        def snd -> T; @b; end
      end
      Pair[Int, Bool].new(1, true).fst

- `env.find_type('S')` should return something
  - Like `Type::Typaram`?
    - Currently it is almost the same as `Object`
    - This object will have the information about upper/lower bound, if introduced
      - to tell if a class confirms to the type

## 2018/03/01

### Keyword argument

(Current idea) All methods can be invoked with keyword arguments.

```
def foo(a: Int = 1, b: Int = 2); end

foo(3, 4)
foo(3, b: 4)     # Allow this?
foo(b: 4, a: 3)
```

### Types in Shiika

:thinking:

- Value types
  - Concrete value types
    - Class type
  - Abstract value types
    - Type parameter
- Non-value types
  - Generic class
  - Method signature
  - Function signature?

## 2018/02/27

### Types in Scala

https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/03-types.html#paths

- Value types
  - Concrete value types
    - Class type
    - Compound type
  - Abstract value types
    - Type parameter
    - Abstract type binding
- Non-value types
  - Type constructor
  - Method type

## 2018/02/25

### Scala functions

- `Int => Int` is just a [shorthand](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/03-types.html#function-types) of `Function1[Int, Int]`
- This type does not include all information about the function (eg. default value for a parameter)
- IOW this type includes all the information for type checking
  - Arity
  - Types of each paraemter
  - Type of the return value

## 2018/02/24

### Signature of closures?

```
f = fn(x){ x + 1 }
```

What is "type" and/or "signature" of f?

## 2018/02/23

### Type vs. Signature

- What is "signature"?
  - Is it a type or not?
- eg. In Haskell:
  - Every value belongs to a type
  - Functions are values
  - So each function belongs to a type such as `f :: Int -> Int`
  - Application `f "foo"` is a type error
- In Shiika, methods are not first-class value
  - But off course, we want to check type errors for method calls
  - There should be information of what a method takes and returns (= Signature)

## 2018/02/20

### Funcion call or variable reference

```rb
  def do_task(after: () -> Void)
    # do something

    # This may look like a function call, but...
    after

    # There's a case that passing `after` to another function,
    # so `after` should be a variable reference.
    do_task_2(after)

    # Allow this?
    after()

    # How about these?
    another()  # Call of another method
    another    # Allow this or prohibit this?
  end

  def another
  end
```

## 2018/02/19

### Nullary-function problem

- Ruby's `Proc` is like function but has different syntax to invoke

```rb
def foo(*args); end
bar = Proc.new

foo  # Method call
bar  # Variable reference
foo(1)  # Method call
bar(1)  # *Error*
bar.call(1)  # OK

bar[1]       # Alternative syntax of call (`#[]` is an alias of `#call`)
bar.(1)      # Alternative syntax of call (rarely used, though)
```

Note that you need to write `bar.call` to invoke the function with 0 arguments.

### Function type?

- Swift has function as first-class value
  - But there is no class for function?
  - https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Types.html#//apple_ref/swift/grammar/function-type
  - Functions and tuples look like special in Swift
- Scala has function as first-class value
  - They are instances of `Function0` 〜 `Function22`
  - With syntax sugar `f(x)` = `f.apply(x)`
  - Method, on the other hand, is not a first-class value
- Ruby has no "function"
  - But has `Proc` class instead
  - Ruby also has `Method` class (not so popular as `Proc`)

## 2018/02/17

### Data structure for types

- What object should `env.find_type` return?
  - It should be able to tell an object conforms (= its class conforms) to the type

### Type syntax

- Types can be appeared in some place of a program
  - Function signature (params, return value)
  - Instance variable type
  - Cast
- Type syntax
  - Class name (non-generic)
    - => An instance of the class or its subclasses
  - Class name (generic)
    - => Illegal (type argument required)
  - Generic class name + type arguments
    - eg. `Stack[Int]`
    - => Instance of the class
    - (This will change once covariance/contravariance are introduced)
  - Type parameter name
    - => An instance of the class Object or its subclasses
    - (Once upper/lower bounds are introduced, instance of a class between the bound)

## 2018/02/16

### What is type

- Given `x: Foo`, x is an instance of Foo or its subclasses
  - Type = set of classes
- `x: Array` is not allowed (missing type argument)
  - Shiika needs a definition of type syntax

### Is `Stack[Int]` a class?

No?

### Generics

Thinking about generics since the new year. Shiika won't have even the class Array without it.

Notes:

- Use `[]` for generics syntax
- Reason1: `<>` is not suitable when `<:` and `>:` are introduced to denote upper/lower bound
  - Swift uses `:` to denote upper bound (No syntax for lower bound)
- Reason2: `Stack[T]` looks like a method call :-)
  - Can we define this as method call?
  - `Stack#[]` to return specialized class

## 2018/02/15

### MetaClass

- In Ruby, `Array` evaluates to an object (an instance of the `Class` class)
- In Shiika too?
- But `Array.new` and `String.new` have different signature
  - In Ruby, `new` is their "singleton method" so they can behave
    differently even the name is the same
- No plan to introduce "singleton method" to Shiika
- MetaClass
  - `Array` evaluates to an object
  - Its class is `Meta:Array` (metaclass of Array)
  - `new` is defined on `Meta:Array`

### Shiika

- Static typing
- Ruby-like syntax
  - But not 100% compatible
- Interpreter is written in Ruby (for now)
  - Future plan: compile to LLVM IR (using Go or something?)
- Challenge
  - Rubyish + Static type system

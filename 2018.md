### Type syntax

- Types can be appeared in some place of a program
  - Function signature (params, return value)
  - Instance variable type
  - Cast
- Type syntax
  - Class name (non-generic)
    - => An instance of the class or its subclasses
  - Class name (generic)
    - => Illegal (type argument required)
  - Generic class name + type arguments
    - eg. `Stack[Int]`
    - => Instance of the class
    - (This will change once covariance/contravariance are introduced)
  - Type parameter name
    - => An instance of the class Object or its subclasses
    - (Once upper/lower bounds are introduced, instance of a class between the bound)

### What is type

- Given `x: Foo`, x is an instance of Foo or its subclasses
  - Type = set of classes
- `x: Array` is not allowed (missing type argument)
  - Shiika needs a definition of type syntax

### Is `Stack[Int]` a class?

No?

### Generics

Thinking about generics since the new year. Shiika won't have even the class Array without it.

Notes:

- Use `[]` for generics syntax
- Reason1: `<>` is not suitable when `<:` and `>:` are introduced to denote upper/lower bound
  - Swift uses `:` to denote upper bound (No syntax for lower bound)
- Reason2: `Stack[T]` looks like a method call :-)
  - Can we define this as method call?
  - `Stack#[]` to return specialized class

### MetaClass

- In Ruby, `Array` evaluates to an object (an instance of the `Class` class)
- In Shiika too?
- But `Array.new` and `String.new` have different signature
  - In Ruby, `new` is their "singleton method" so they can behave
    differently even the name is the same
- No plan to introduce "singleton method" to Shiika
- MetaClass
  - `Array` evaluates to an object
  - Its class is `Meta:Array` (metaclass of Array)
  - `new` is defined on `Meta:Array`

### Shiika

- Static typing
- Ruby-like syntax
  - But not 100% compatible
- Interpreter is written in Ruby (for now)
  - Future plan: compile to LLVM IR (using Go or something?)
- Challenge
  - Rubyish + Static type system
